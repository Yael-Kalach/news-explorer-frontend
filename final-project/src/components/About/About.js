            <p className="about__text">Hi, my name is Yael Kalach! I'm a junior fullstack programmar and an experienced graphic designer.</p>
            <p className="about__text">I took up coding because I aspire to become a game dev one day, and Javascript seemed like a good place to start my perilous - and often furstrating - journey.</p>
            <p className="about__text">During my studies with Practicum I learned a lot of things about coding, but also how crucial time management is to success, and how difficult it is to learn it.</p>
